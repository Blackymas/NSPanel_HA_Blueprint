# v2025102 - Build Fix for Verbose Logging

## Summary

This hotfix release resolves a compilation issue that prevented building when log level was set
to VERBOSE or VERY_VERBOSE, along with other minor fixes.

## Critical Fix

### Build Failure with Verbose Logging

**Fixed compilation error with verbose log levels** - resolved build failure that occurred when
log level was set to VERBOSE or VERY_VERBOSE.

**Issue details:**
- Build failed when using `VERBOSE` or `VERY_VERBOSE` log levels
- Compilation succeeded with lower log levels (INFO, DEBUG, etc.)
- Code issue only manifested with verbose logging enabled

**Result:** Project now builds successfully with all log levels, including VERBOSE and
VERY_VERBOSE.

## Bug Fixes

### Minor Issue Corrections

**Fixed a few minor issues** - addressed some small bugs and inconsistencies discovered after
v2025101 release.

**Result:** Improved overall stability and reliability.
