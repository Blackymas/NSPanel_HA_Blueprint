# v4.3.26 - Stability Improvements

## Summary

This release primarily addresses issues introduced in v4.3.20 during the early response to the ESPHome 2025.8.0 boot crisis.
Additionally, includes some adjustments aimed at helping with the ongoing boot compatibility issues.

## Key Improvements

### Crisis-Introduced Issue Resolution

**Fixed multiple issues that were introduced in v4.3.20** when implementing the initial emergency response to the ESPHome 2025.8.0 boot problems.
The early crisis fixes, while addressing the immediate boot failures, inadvertently created secondary issues that affected system stability and functionality.

**Issues resolved:**
- Restored functionality that was impacted by emergency timing adjustments
- Improved system stability after boot sequence completion

### Additional Boot Crisis Improvements

**Implemented further adjustments** in an ongoing effort to resolve the remaining ESPHome 2025.8.0 boot compatibility issues.
While the root cause remains under investigation, these changes aim to improve boot reliability for affected users.

**Boot-related improvements:**
- Continued optimization of boot timing and component loading
- Enhanced compatibility with ESPHome 2025.8.0+ versions

## Technical Details

This release demonstrates the iterative nature of crisis resolution - sometimes initial emergency fixes create secondary issues that need to be addressed in subsequent releases.
The focus here is on stabilizing the system after the emergency response period while continuing to work toward a complete solution for the boot compatibility issues.

**Result:** More stable system behavior with reduced side effects from crisis response measures, while maintaining improvements in boot compatibility.
