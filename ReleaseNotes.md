## Breaking Changes and Guidance

### Home Assistant v2024.11.0 and ESPHome v2024.11.0 are required
Refer to our  
[Version Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/Blackymas/NSPanel_HA_Blueprint/blob/main/docs/version_compatibility.md).

### Versioning changes require updating all three components
Update all components (Blueprint, ESPHome, and TFT) together for compatibility and consistency.

### Diagnostic sensors removed
Some diagnostic sensors were removed to free memory for new features. Their values are logged; request custom  
sensor support via an issue if required.

### "Display as a light" customization removed
This feature is now part of the core system. Remove the related YAML customization from your configuration.

### API changes and standardization
All actions now use a unified method to transfer information, reducing overhead and improving responsiveness  
between ESPHome and Nextion. Visit the updated [API documentation](docs/api.md) for details.

#### Key API Changes:
1. **Deprecated actions**  
   <!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->  
   | Deprecated action                  | Replacement              | Previous use                    |  
   | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------------- |  
   | `init_global`, `init_hardware`     | `set_number`, `set_string` | Sent settings at boot          |  
   | `init_page_home`                   | [`component`](docs/api.md#component-action-component) | Sent values to page Home |  
   | `set_timezone`                     | `set_string`             | Sent timezone settings         |  
   | `component_text`, `icon`, etc.     | [`component`](docs/api.md#component-action-component) | Set display components |  
   <!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

2. **Sensors `blueprint_status` and `device_name` removed**
   Device's and boot info is now transferred via events.

3. **Notification unread switch replaced**
   The "**Notification unread**" switch is now a binary sensor.

4. **Baud rate selectors removed**
   Communication now detects the Nextion display's current baud rate
   and changes it to 921,600bps (default target rate).
   Therefore the baud rate selectors have been removed, simplifying configuration.
   A substitution named `BAUD_RATE` can be used by advanced users to change the target baud rate.

5. **New "Display Command Spacing" control**
   A new control called **Display Command Spacing** has been introduced to manage the delay between commands sent to the Nextion display.
   This helps avoid buffer overflows, which can lead to a device restart if not managed properly.
   You can find more details in the [Performance Settings for NSPanel Project](docs/performance.md#2-esphome-performance-setting-display-command-spacing).

### Customizations
Updated scripts require adjustments to these customizations:  
- [Sleep & Wake-up buttons](docs/customization.md#sleep--wake-up-buttons)  
- [Set display as a light (deprecated)](docs/customization.md#set-display-as-a-light)

### Dropped support to *Wall Display*
This was an experimental feature, but the available memory on the NSPanel can't support all the desired features.

## Noteworthy Changes

### Core and Standard Functionality Split
In this release, we are introducing a new split between "Core" and "Standard" functionalities.  
This change is aimed at advanced users who wish to customize their panel by selectively removing  
certain functionalities to free up resources for other uses.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unless you want to remove some functionality, no changes are needed on your panel's yaml.

#### Background
Previously, we introduced the concept of `add-ons`, which allowed your panel to act as a Bluetooth proxy,  
local thermostat, or cover control, extending its capabilities beyond the core functionality.  
Now, we're taking a step further by splitting the core functionality into "Core" and "Standard" categories:  
- **Core Functionality:** Essential features required for any panel installation.  
- **Standard Functionality:** Common features included by default in regular installations, but optional for advanced users.

#### Benefits of the Split
1. **Resource Optimization:**  
   Advanced users can remove unused functionalities, freeing up memory for custom uses unrelated to this project.  
   - Example: If you're not using hardware relays, you can remove the package for Hardware Relays to free up resources.  
   - Similarly, if cover control is not used, you can exclude the related code.

2. **Improved Code Management:**  
   Each feature is now encapsulated in a dedicated package, making it easier to locate and customize specific functionality.  
   Developers and troubleshooters can focus on isolated areas of the code without interfering with unrelated parts.

3. **Future Accessibility:**  
   While currently targeted at advanced users, this split lays the groundwork for making functionality selection  
   more accessible for all users, including entry-level users, in future releases.

#### What's Next
While this change is currently focused on advanced users, we are working towards making it easier for all users,
allowing everyone to select what functionalities they want during installation in a more intuitive way.
