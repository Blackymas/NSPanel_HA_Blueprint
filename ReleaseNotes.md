# v4.3.27 - Boot Loop Improvements and System Stability

## Summary

This release focuses on significant improvements to the boot loop issues affecting ESPHome 2025.8.0+ compatibility.
While not a complete solution, testing shows meaningful progress in boot reliability,
particularly for configurations that were previously failing consistently.

## Key Improvements

### Boot Loop Issue Progress

**Significant improvements to boot reliability** based on extensive testing and refinements to the boot sequence.
While the root cause investigation continues, this release shows measurable progress in reducing boot failures.

**Testing results:**
- **Climate add-on now boots successfully** - no longer breaks the boot sequence in testing
- **Overall system stability improved** - fewer random crashes during boot
- **Better recovery rates** for most configurations

**Current compatibility status:**
- ✅ **Climate add-on** - appears to boot reliably now
- ⚠️ **Cover add-on** - still causes boot issues, but OTA recovery possible during safe mode (remove add-on to recover)
- ❌ **Bluetooth components** - still problematic, may require USB/TTL recovery

### System Stability Enhancements

**Resolved additional issues** introduced during the early crisis response in v4.3.20.
Users should experience more stable system behavior overall,
with fewer side effects from the emergency compatibility measures.

**Stability improvements:**
- Reduced system instability after successful boot
- Better overall performance and responsiveness
- Fewer unexpected behaviors during normal operation

## Current Boot Issue Status

**We're making progress, but there's still work to do.**

**If you're currently stable - don't change anything yet!**

**If you've been affected by boot loops:**
- **Climate add-on users** - this release should resolve your boot issues
- **Cover add-on users** - remove the add-on temporarily, update, then consider re-adding cautiously
- **Bluetooth users** - continue to avoid these components for now

**For persistent boot issues:**
- Basic configurations should work more reliably with this release
- USB/TTL flashing may still be needed for severe cases

## Technical Details

This release represents continued iteration on boot sequence optimization and component loading timing.
The improvements are based on systematic testing and gradual refinement rather than major architectural changes,
resulting in more predictable behavior across different configuration types.

**Result:** Measurably improved boot success rates while maintaining system stability,
with particular success for climate add-on configurations that were previously failing.
