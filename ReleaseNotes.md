# v4.3.31 - Bug Fixes and Communication Improvements

## Summary

This release focuses primarily on fixing several reported bugs while including additional optimizations
for boot reliability and Nextion display communication.

## Bug Fixes

### Lamp Control Issues Resolved
**Fixed reboots when trying to dim or change color temperature of lamps** - resolved crashes that occurred during lamp control operations.

### Home Screen Responsiveness Fixed  
**Resolved unresponsive home screen when pressing temperature or weather areas** - touch interactions now work properly for these interface elements.

### Display Sleep Functionality Restored
**Fixed display sleep (0s) not working after upgrade to v4.3.30** - sleep functionality now operates correctly following the memory optimization changes.

### Blueprint Compatibility Issue Resolved
**Fixed "Waiting for Blueprint..." issue with v4.3.30** - resolved compatibility problems that prevented proper Blueprint communication.

## Performance Improvements

### Boot and Communication Optimizations
**Additional refinements to boot sequence and Nextion communication** to improve system reliability and responsiveness.

**Improvements include:**
- Enhanced boot sequence timing for better reliability
- Optimized communication protocols with Nextion display
- Reduced potential for communication timeouts and errors
- Better system stability during startup and operation

## Technical Details

This release addresses user-reported issues that emerged after recent memory optimization efforts,
ensuring that the stability improvements don't come at the cost of core functionality.
The boot and communication optimizations build on previous work to enhance overall system reliability.

**Result:** Resolved critical functionality issues while maintaining memory optimizations
and improving boot reliability and display communication.
