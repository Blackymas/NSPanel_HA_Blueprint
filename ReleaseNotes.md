# v4.3.21 - Enhanced Boot Stability for ESPHome 2025.8.0+

## Summary

This hotfix addresses persistent boot issues with ESPHome 2025.8.0 by implementing a more robust boot sequence with enhanced logging and timing adjustments.

## Key Improvements

### Enhanced Boot Stability

**Improved boot engine reliability** for ESPHome 2025.8.0 and later versions. 
This release introduces timing optimizations and enables serial logging (required for proper boot sequence execution) to address remaining boot issues that some users experienced after the v4.3.20 update.

**Changes include:**
- Added strategic delays during boot sequence to reduce system intensity
- Enabled serial logging (required for boot sequences to execute properly with ESPHome 2025.8.0+)
- Rebuilt boot engine with more conservative timing approach

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly longer boot times in exchange for improved stability
- Additional warning messages in logs about components taking longer than expected (will be addressed in future releases)

**Issues Reference:**
- #2685
- #2686

## Technical Details

This release prioritizes boot reliability over speed, implementing a more conservative approach to system initialization. The enhanced logging will help identify any remaining edge cases, while the timing adjustments provide more breathing room for system components during startup.

Users who previously experienced successful boots with v4.3.20 will see minimal changes, while those who continued to experience issues should see improved stability.
