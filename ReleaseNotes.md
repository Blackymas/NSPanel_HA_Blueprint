# v4.3.24 - Button Display Reliability Fix

## Summary

This hotfix resolves a button display issue that emerged after the boot timing improvements in v4.3.21,
ensuring all buttons are properly rendered on the display.

## Key Improvements

### Button Display Queue System

**Fixed missing buttons on display** caused by timing conflicts between button rendering requests.
The boot delays implemented in v4.3.21 to resolve ESPHome 2025.8.0 compatibility inadvertently caused individual button rendering to take longer,
leading to subsequent button requests either failing or canceling previous ones.

**Solution implemented:**
- **Moved button constructor to a queued script system** that processes button rendering requests sequentially
- **Ensures all buttons are properly displayed** by preventing timing conflicts between multiple button requests
- **Maintains boot stability improvements** from previous releases while fixing the display issue

**Result:** All buttons now render reliably, regardless of system timing constraints.

## Technical Details

This issue demonstrates how performance optimizations can sometimes reveal secondary timing dependencies.
The sequential queuing approach ensures robust button rendering while preserving the boot stability improvements that were essential for ESPHome 2025.8.0 compatibility.

*This targeted fix ensures complete button functionality while maintaining the stability improvements from recent releases.*
