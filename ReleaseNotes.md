# v4.3.25 - Enhanced Display Component Reliability and Performance

## Summary

This release extends the queuing system introduced in v4.3.24 to additional display components and optimizes boot timing for better performance without compromising stability.

## Key Improvements

### Comprehensive Component Queue System

**Extended queued rendering system** beyond button pages to cover additional display components that could experience similar timing conflicts.
Building on the successful button fix in v4.3.24, this release applies the same sequential processing approach to prevent rendering conflicts across all affected components.

**Components now using queued processing:**

- Button pages (previously fixed in v4.3.24)
- Additional display components susceptible to timing conflicts
- All components that interact with display rendering during boot sequence

### Optimized Boot Timing

**Refined boot delays for improved efficiency** while maintaining ESPHome 2025.8.0 compatibility.
The timing adjustments have been fine-tuned to provide better performance without compromising the stability improvements that resolved the original boot issues.

**Performance improvements:**

- **More efficient boot sequence** with optimized delay timing
- **Faster overall boot times** while preserving compatibility fixes
- **Reduced system overhead** through smarter timing management

## Technical Details

This release represents a comprehensive approach to display timing management, applying lessons learned from the button rendering fix to the broader system. The optimized delays strike a better balance between performance and reliability.

**Result:** More responsive system performance with robust component rendering across all display elements.
