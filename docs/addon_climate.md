# Add-on: Climate

## Description

This add-on enables the use of your panel's relays to act as a thermostat (either cooler or heater)
using the internal temperature sensor and independent of the network availability.

### Attention
1. The NSPanel is limited to 2A per relay.
Don't use it for directly power your cooler/heater if exceeding the panel specifications:
    - 150W/110V/Gang, 300W/110V/Total
    - 300W/220V/Gang, 600W/220V/Total
2. A target temperature must be set on the climate entity in Home Assistant or the page Climate in your panel.

## Installation

You will need to add the reference to `addon_climate_heat`, `addon_climate_cool` or `addon_climate_dual` files on your ESPHome settings in the `package` section
and after the `remote_package` (base code), as shown below (for `heat` in this example):

> [!NOTE]
> Occasionally, ESPHome updates may result in the `entity_id` of embedded thermostats being appended with `_2`. 
> If you experience this change, refer to this [forum post](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/esphome-devices-all-renamed-with-2-added/388146) on the Home Assistant Forum for guidance.

### Real Use Case Example: Water Underfloor Heating with NSPanel
The NSPanel works nicely as a replacement for existing water underfloor heating controllers, installed at eye level and often powered by 100-240VAC.
In my specific use case, the control valve is of the 'normally closed' type, meaning that an open relay indicates 'no heating.'
I have utilized relay #1 for this purpose. It's important to note that this setup does not act as a PID controller, but operates on a simple on-off mechanism.
The system initiates heating at a preset value below and turns it off at a value above the set point.
I have set these values to `0.1°C` below and `0.1°C` above the target temperature, respectively.
These adjustments have been effectively maintaining the desired temperature in all of our four rooms.
The thermostat's settings range from a minimum of `15°C` to a maximum of `22°C`, with a granularity of `0.1°C` for adjustments.
Furthermore, I have selected `18.3°C` as the default target temperature.

```yaml
 ##### addon-configuration #####
  ## addon_climate ##
  heater_relay: "1" #Use relay 1
  temp_min: "15" 
  temp_max: "22" 
  temp_step: "0.1"
  cold_tolerance: "0.1"
  hot_tolerance: "0.1"
    
  ##### CHANGE ME END #####
climate:
  - id: !extend thermostat_embedded
    visual:
      temperature_step: ${temp_step}
    preset:
      - name: Home
        default_target_temperature_low: 18.3
        mode: "heat"
```

Please note that employing any filter to smooth the temperature readings, such as averaging, is discouraged if the relevant timescale exceeds 1min.
Such filtering methods can delay the response times of an already slow underfloor heating system.
Despite this, the temperature stability achieved is quite satisfactory, as illustrated in the graph below.

*On March 24th (around 9:20 PM) and March 25th (around 7:30AM) a window was opened, and all heaters were set to 'off.' for 30min*
